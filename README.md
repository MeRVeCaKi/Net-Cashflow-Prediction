Organizing data, classifying data, examining the relationship between data sets using a correlation map, making predictions for data sets that are related by training a Linear Regression model, data visualization, making predictions using models even though we do not have any data about the future, making predictions using different regression models, measuring the performance of our prediction by using statistical formulas are the data science snippets I made in this project.

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn are the main data science libraries that I used in this project.
